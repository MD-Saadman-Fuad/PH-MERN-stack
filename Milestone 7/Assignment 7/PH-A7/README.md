## What is JSX, and why is it used?

JSX is like writing HTML inside JavaScript. It makes React code easier to read and write because it looks familiar like HTML.

## What is the difference between State and Props?

State is like a component's memory that it can change itself. Props are given from parent components that the component can't change.

## What is the useState hook, and how does it work?

useState gives a component memory to remember and change values. It returns the current value and a function to update it, causing the component to re-render when changed.

## How can you share state between components in React?

Put the state in the parent component and pass it down as props to child components. This way multiple components can use and update the same data.

## How is event handling done in React?

You write functions and connect them to elements using event props like onClick or onChange. React calls your function when the user interacts with the element.
